I review what I'm done so far.

- (bank) I don't like waste my time at a bank. So, I went to the bank at 9 a.m. I was surprised to see some people who are already there. I had to take a number and wait.

- (bike) I got a new bike for 18th birthday gift. It was first my bike and I liked a lot. One day, I parked my bike near the subway station and someone stole it. I cried for a week.

- (vending machine) The weather was boiling hot and I was so thirsty. I found a vending machine and tried to get a cold soda. I put some coins in, but the vending machine ate my coins. I was so upset and gave it a kick. It spat out my coins.

- (gas station) The gas price keeps on rising. So I always checked the gas price per liter and look for the lowest one in my town. Yesterday, however, the low gas singal came up so I just went to the nearest gas station.

- (housework) After my dad retired, my dad helps my mom to work with the housework. He tried to cook but it couldn't eat it at all. My mom told him to do the dishes instead. When my mom cooks, my dad does the dishes afterwards.

- I was sitting on the bus. An old lady got on and stood next to the person in front of me. I thought he would stand up but he didn't. I felt bad and gave up my seat to the old lady.

- I took the driver's license test for both automatic and stick shift cars. I know how to drive both of them. However, my first car was an automatic car and I hardly got to drive stick shift car. Automatic cars are much easier to drive.
