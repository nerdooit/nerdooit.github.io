### Today English
- When I finish a book, I always write a book report on it. It helps to organize my thoughts. Last weekend, I read an interesting novel. After that, I spent two hours writing a book report on it.

- I like to keep my books clean. I try to take good care of the books. When I read, I never write on or fold the pages. So I don't like lending my books to friends. It bothers me when my friend returns the book with folded pages.
